This website collects the ongoing adventures of the Wasteland Heroes in the greater Korokno region of [via](https://svia.nl)'s Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 world.

Some basic information:

- The posts are meant for our group only.
- Sometimes you will encounter some secret text, encrypted by GPG.  To decrypt this nicely in your browser, we advice you to install the [WebPG](https://webpg.org/) plugin, which is available for Firefox and Chrome.
- Writing some secret text follows the following format:

  > <pre>
  > BEGIN SECRET INFO
  > For: $NAMES
  >
  > $MESSAGE
  > END SECRET INFO
  > </pre>

  A [vim plugin](https://github.com/pkok/vim-gnupg-snippets) can automatically decrypt and encrypt a `SECRET INFO` block, if you are allowed to read the text.  `$NAMES` is a comma-separated list of unique identifiers ((parts of) names, email addresses and public key fingerprints).  The colon (`:`) is optional.  
- All dates of up to the [Outcome 18]({% post_url 2015-01-28-Outcome-18:-Nomads-Arrive,-Magic-Item-Madness %}) are correlated to the logs ages after the sessions have been played.  They are correlated by checking our calendars (which didn't contain all meetings), and last-modified timestamps of the original log files by the DM.  Only the dates of [Outcome 2a]({% post_url 2013-07-01-Outcome-2a:-Trustworthiness %}), [3]({% post_url 2013-08-01-Outcome-3:-Who's-Playin'-Fair-Now? %}) and [14]({% post_url 2014-07-16-Outcome-14 %}) are based on guesswork.
