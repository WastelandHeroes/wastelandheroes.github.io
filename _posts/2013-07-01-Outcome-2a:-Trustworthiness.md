The party awakens and orders breakfast at the inn (Boole actually ordering creme brulle, for that is normal in his home country) and the inn keeper gives Boole two items. The first is an official letter, the second a scrap of paper.

OFFICIAL LETTER (smells of strawberry, but has a seal and everything):

> AKT 139, Korokno
> 
> To Boole, The chivalrous knight of Xatar,
> 
> It has come to our attention that thy and thou servants have personally witnessed the distasteful murder of our dear friend Phar.
> 
> In regards to resolve this terrible act we would welcome thou to discuss these horrible matters at hand in our tavern, 'The Jolyjok', at midday today.
> 
> I am hopeful that we can initiate a mutual beneficial relationship.
> 
> Your faithfully,
> Krok of the house of Pikur, son of Kle-ka Pikur.

CRAP PIECE:

> Care to talk in regards to recent events?
> 
> Korokno needs good folks.
> 
> Meet me at the Tor keep, midday, today.
> 
> ~P

Boole (Patrick) and Djeke (Maarten) go to the Jolyjok inn, Arya (Chiel) and Tomas (Stein) go to the keep.

## The Jolyjok
Boole and Djeke get to the inn and are brought to Krok's room by a person constantly performing small firey tricks, they later find out he is called Fire. Krok would like to be called Smoke, and his room has a thick layer of smoke on the rooms floor from him constantly smoking a water pipe with special flavours (one of which is strawberry), Smoke explains that shops of the houses of Pikur have been terrorized and that he wants to hire the party for a total of 200 gold pieces to spy on The Band at the Tan Tannery tonight at midnight. He explains that there is high abandoned house which they could use.

He explains that the house is important and rich but that they can not spare any more man power than hireing some adventurers. Djeke, smoking his pipe, finds this fellow unbelievably awesome and decides to just plain trust him, not even roling a sense motive check.

## The Keep
In the meanwhile, Arya (with disguise self casted, but soon discarded) and Tomas get to the keep, are let inside by someone standing outside. Inside they find a young woman with a cape over her head, they can not see her face.

She greets the two and explains more or less the same as Smoke had done, when suddenly they hear ruckus outside. They take defensive positions behind the table the woman was sitting and two barbarians storm inside. Arya jumps on the table and colour sprays one. Tomas attempts to charm person the other but fails and is then hit extremely hard (actually the hit was nearly a critical one) bringing him to -5 hit points. Arya knocks out the other barbarian while the girl heals Tomas.

After the fight a person (wearing pitch black leather armor) jumps down from a hiding place which was up against the ceiling, she says she is terribly sorry for the secrecy but that she had to know if they could be trusted, and that by the way they handled her assassins she could see she can trust them.  She takes a healing potion from the dead guy outside and brings back Tomas to the land of the conscious.

She introduces herself as Petara, but everyone calls her Sneak. Her older brother, Smoke, took over control of the house of Pikur when their father became senile.  Now she suspects he has made business arrangements with The Band. They agree to spy for her tonight at midnight.

## Side-trip to the Island
Some buy some supplies, such as a grappling hook. Tomas is still quite hurt and decides to go to the island and seek some help from the Order. At the gate, waiting for the ferry to the island is a group of about 25 people who look like they are nearly starving but obviously do not have any money to get to the island. Tomas pays them all to go along.

At the island the Order is surprised by so many people. They agree to help Tomas, and the group of people for a small compensation paid for by Tomas. And then they sail back to the city. On the main square one of the two robed priests of the Order start speaking nearly magically, and as a crowd gathers they talk about how there are hard times to come and that the Order is busy fighting undead in the desert.  Nevertheless, the Order shall take care of the city. Knights step forward and magically create food for the starving people.

## Tan Tannery
Boole and Arya (splitting up the party differently this time), scout the location by day time, Arya got sick for the first couple of minutes of the stench of the tanneries. They found the place as described by Smoke.

At night they get back early. They clean out a small shed with a dire rat in it, and then hide Boole in it. Arya goes in the (by Kork suggested) house with a great vantage point but hears there is someone up the roof. Outside she sees archers, she casts hastily retreat or something and runs away.

Boole keeps quiet in the shed, the door opens and a guy similarly armed as him steps in. Boole takes some hits but wins, then storms outside to kill a dog with an archer (now on the street) as well. After that, Arya gets back.

## The Meet
Djeke and Tomas do not scout at daytime, but do get early at the place where, according to Sneak, some kind of meet was supposed to go down.

Near their target location they meet a junky who wants them to "hook him up".  He can show them around the hood if they'd like but Tomas and Djeke decline.

The two hide and after a while they see two guys meeting with a guy which looks humanoid but also kinda not (he stands within shadows), he has a wolf as large as a horse with him. Djeke's bardic knowledge says it is a druid, and stories have been going around about beasts terrorizing the city at night.

The druid and his wolf leave. After a while three guys carrying crates follow the two guys who stayed behind in a house and then the three leave empty handed.

Tomas and Djeke scout the house, after a while one of them goes out to pee.  They detect magic and feel a faint magic aura originating from within the house. Having no better option but to storm in they storm in, they take out the guys but not before they flip a coin which again disappears in mid air. They grab a handful of tiny purple mushrooms, loot the place (finding a grey pouch and another strange coin) and leave but not before Djeke stabilizes one bad guy who went down in the fight.

On the way to the inn Tomas discovers the pouch holds furry balls which turn into animals once outside the bag.
