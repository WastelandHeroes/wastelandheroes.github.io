# Prelude

The party consists of:

* Djeke, chaotic good bard, Maarten. He loves to smoke a pipe and play on his well crafted lute which is the only thing he still got from his parents.
* Arya, chaotic neutral beguiler, Chiel. Enjoys the usual scams and sneakiness.
* Boole, Lawfull Good paladin, Patrick. He has a code with 10 commitments he can not break. Loves to play his nobility and his supposed godsendness. He looks and sounds exotic.
* Tomas, chaotic good(?) sorcerer, Stein. Grew up in the city, scammed the Order for some bit by hiding that his magic powers were actually divine instead of arcane.

Djeke and Arya grew up together after they lost their parents way back on some kind of ambush while they were travelling as a family. They then grew up Oliver Twist style in the bad part of Kaak.

At some point Arya wanted to adventure and do mighty things as those described in Djeke's many songs. One day they saw a black paladin come off the boat and decided that Boole was the excellent person they required as muscle for their adventures.
