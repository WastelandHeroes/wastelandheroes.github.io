title: "Outcome 25"

The party discusses on the market square what they are going to do today! So
many options. Should they raid the tower with the eyes in the wall, spy on the
council meeting, steal Smokes gold or find Sneak? Perhaps they should kill THE
DEFENDER and see what is behind the door he was guarding ...

The party does none of this. First they purchase some magical shrooms from a
nearby vendor that sells mostly vegetables. Then they visit aunt Katana and
uncle Kor to see how the bugs are doing. They learn the bugs are doing extremely
well: they are laying eggs to make baby bugs.

Then they go to the theatre to see if people are still being executed at midday
each day. The security of the theatre has been upped since they slaughtered a
whole bunch of Turaku there last time. There are more archers on the wall, and
the guards at the entrances quickly close and barricade the doors. A captain
shouts from the wall that they will not be allowed inside. He seems a bit
nervous that the party might try. He flips a coin which disappears in mid air.

The party decide to wait what to see who will show up. Presently two very large
eagles approach and start circling the party at about 500 ft. After a short
discussion the party decides to raid one of the newly built towers because they
will probably learn more from that than raiding the theatre again.

The people working and chilling around the towers quickly run away and inside as
the party approaches. They were building another tower nearby. Djeke tries to
see what song was played (perhaps with the lyre of building) and learns that no
song was played yesterday. The eagles kept following them steadily.

They see that the towers are very well built. Each on defends the other towers.
There are defensive slits which offer 90% cover. The doors are faced inwards to
the centre of the towers.

When the party decides to approach the towers an arrow is shot in front of their
feet. Someone proclaims that the party has no authority here and that they are
not wanted here. As such they should simply leave he reckons.

Unimpressed Enkidu attempts to wild empathy the eagles which apparently pisses
off something as he is immediately hit by a lightning storm bolt.

And so the party charges the nearest tower. All except for Enkidu which tries to
fly towards the eagles.

Magic missiles, arrows, scorching rays rain down on the party. Enkidu is hit
more with lightning. Arya lays down a protective fog and Horg smashes the door.

While Enkidu nearly dies outside the rest charges upstairs. They find rich
merchants, some are protected by men at arms, sorcerers and archers. Once
inside there does not seem to be a whole lot of trouble though some glitter dust
and grease caused some annoyance for Horg.

After Enkidu is healed he again tries to confront the druid outside. He casts
flaming strike on the tower. This blasts away the roof and hits the strongest
dire eagle but also exposes a looting Djeke and Enkidus enraged tiger Mertle.

The dire eagle promptly flies to Enkidu and attacks him. While the druid casts a
much more powerful flaming strike on the exposed party. Djeke, Rafael go down in
the negative.  Mertle is left with single digit HP.

While all this is going on, the merchants, which were basically cowering in
fear, manage to escape.

After Arya lays down another cover of fog above the now burning tower and
carries Rafael downstairs while Horg carries Djeke. Halfway they meet with
Enkidu who heals brings them back to consciousness.

Tower layout. Near the blue dice is the ground floor, with a Obscuring Mist in front. Enkidu and Myrtle are standing on the second floor, with on the first floor a decapitated body. Horg and Arya runs downwards, carrying Djeke and Rafael.  Serilius is looting on the top floor.

Meanwhile, the druid summons a Dire Lion which attacks the looting Serilious
upstairs. This beast proves extremely troublesome and Mertle goes down to -8 HP.
There is some trouble as the fight is on the tiny staircase and people can not
really be reached. Luckily the party manages to slay the lion and they retreat
downstairs where they loot the place, and identify some stuff. Not long before a
Dire Board comes down but, better prepared and positioned they dispose of it
without too much trouble.

The tower has been captured and looted! But they are still inside. They do not
want to take ownership of the tower as it has been damaged. Arya insists on
blasting away the druids and slowly a plan forms. Serilious casts four different
fly spells on whole party and Enkidu shares his spell with Mertle. We put on
ride of the Valkyries and off they go!

The eagles seem to not have that many spells left. A VERY confusing chase scene
unfolds. Arya hastes the whole party. Enkidu had summoned a large air elemental.
Serilious blasts away with fireballs.

The druid quickly realizes that this is not going in his favor and tries to
flee but with a hastened party he will not come very far. Just as he make a
ditch to the river Serilious manages to blast him with a pyroblast which is
extremely lethal for the druid and he dies! There is not even a body to recover
left!

And thats where the session ends. It is d-day -5 at around midday. The whole
city has been stirred up by flaming pillars of divine fire, fireball explosions
in the air, lightning strikes, flying animals, people and smoke of a burning
tower.
