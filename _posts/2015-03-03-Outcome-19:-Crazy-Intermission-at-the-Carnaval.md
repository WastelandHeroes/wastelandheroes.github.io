title: "Outcome 19: Crazy intermission at the carnaval"
---

They are invited for dinner by Biswax. At dinner there are some merchants with
whom they have spoken, and also Wiz. Wiz is an old man who mostly ignores
everyone. He has some babes taking care of his every need and at the end of the
dinner he retreats into a extra-dimensional room. They drink extremely nice wine
and they eat really fancy stuff, even icecream at some point. They also get to
meet Biswax, the current leader of the caravan, and his son Rosto. Scrom and his
daughter Julia are there as well. Some of the party notice Julia and Rosto
eyeing each other. Of course Djeke impresses everyone present by playing a great
song. Even Wiz seemed a bit impressed.

After dinner, Enkidu goes to hunt out at night. He sees black knights on
horseback riding away from the city. He decides to follow them. The knights
travel to a village and proceed to completely slaughter all its inhabitants and
burn it to the ground.  Enkidu casts one spell, resulting in the knights taking
notice of Enkidu (who was in wildshape). He sees his brother Boole looking up to
him as he raises his hammer and lands a solid blow on a poor villagers head.
Enkidu flies back quickly.

The next day they want to investigate this attack but they are going to the
[fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-t_G_c4rss&list=PLE7C72B243D5320F4)
instead (TD was co-DMing after all). They eat strange carnaval food, get scared
in the ghost house (TD yells BOO!) and get scammed by a con artist (following 1
ball under 3 cups). There is even a clown making balloon animals. At the Amazing
place of Wins they can throw nice, as Scrom does, or shoot the bow, at targets
to win prices. A little girl won a rabbit which Scrom pulled out of a bag. The
party of course also plays but this time Scrom pulls out of the bag a bear, a
tiger and a rhinoceros. Afterwards Scrom says "I though you lads were up for a
giggle"

Then they are invited by Biswax to join him and his son Rosto for a ride in the
ferris wheel. On top of the ferris wheel they hear some sort of explosion and
see that the connection of the wheel is broken and that the wheel is beginning
to roll away. [Great panic ensues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF-Rl5acQdA)
To make matters worse; three clows jump up the wheel. From the flowers pinned to
their chest they cast grease, and they throw blinding pies.  They're after
Biswax for sure. The balloon animals the clown was making turn out to be
actually summoned animals which also join the fight.

Arya casts some kind of fog which nearly stops the wheel from rolling any
further and allows people to jump down from the wheel. Serilious blasts away the
balloon caster. More chaos ensues. Finally it turned out that Scrom was one of
the clowns, he was after Biswax. It ends with lots of casualties on the clowns
part. Scrom dies whilst trying to desperately kill Biswax.

His business went bad as Biswax invaded his 'territory' with the newly purchased
ferris wheel. Scrom, being highly inflammable, was deemed incapable to lead the
caravan by his father Wiz, who preferred Biswax. To make matters worse their son
and daughter started dating, something Scrom called rape.

Ah well. All's well that ends well?
