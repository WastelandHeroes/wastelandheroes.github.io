The party spends some time talking to the refugee elves from which they learn
little. Then they go and seek out what is left of house Doshu. There they learn
some tactics about how the orcs handle things.

The next morning they buy four of Otto's bags and then they leave Kiru.
Serilious makes a mental note to remember the guard at the gatehouse. He is
called Red because of his red beard.

After a couple of hours following the river Rafael reports that an orc raiding
party is moving parallel to them a couple hundred feet into the wasteland. The
party chooses to ignore them and continue.

They stay the night at some farm houses. The next day they travel through the
wasteland, heading towards Red Rock. They encounter the orc raiding party.

Serilious' fireball decimates the raiding party. With some rhinoceros charges
and further combined effort they manage to take care of the party and obtain
lots of loot:

* 6000 gp worth of gems and gold and the like
* 3 human heads
* amulet of natural armor +2
* ring of 4 winds
* shirt of the leech, 30 ft steal heal action (level 4 or lower) MIC 135 (blood
red shirt). 3/day, immediate action
* 10 orc heads

After the encounter they continue travelling.

The next day they move on and they arrive in Red Rock late at night. Father
Gregor welcomes them and says he probably met the fellows they are looking for
this morning. They were acting kinda odd. He offered some soup which they ate
through the visors of their helmets. Enkidu tries to help rebuild and uses warp
wood to build a house of part of the batch of timber that is laying around.

At night the church bells ring. The party awakens. There is chaos on the street
as peasants flee to a safe location. Father Gregor asks if the party will
dispose of the danger moving into the town as he takes care of the villagers.

The danger is a Mohrg. The party takes to the sky while Horg jumps on a
building. Nothing they have is really effective. They chip away at the Mohrg
with whatever ranged stuff they have until they notice more undead moving into
the town.

Horg crashes down the reinforcing zombies that are moving in. Two of those
zombies are in black full plates and one of them wields a hammer. They manage to
destroy all the undead and they are kinda of puzzled by the hammer that is
crudely painted like the talking hammer of Boole.

Gregor inspects the zombies they just destroyed and confirms that the two with
the black full plate are, or were, definitely the two fellas he thought the
party was after. Serilious is disappointed that they will now probably will not
go to the light house. Session ends.
