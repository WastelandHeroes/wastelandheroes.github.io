## Prelude
When our four victors approach the bookie they get a lot of angry stares all around. Apparently not many in the crowd shared their confidence for the return is not quite bad. Of course, it is not magnificent either, just a little bit less than 3 gold pieces per gold piece wagered. But what can one expect of these poor folks?

As the bookie sorts out the cash The King approaches. The giant of a man talks with his low but loud voice: "Turaku demands coin. Funeral costs." He grumbles as he grabs a handful deter coins.

Partys booty remainder: 2870 gp

But when will Sneak return with the money of the magical sling?

## Party, Death and Darkness
The party goes to temple island to see if Keth has returned from his raiding party and to get healed, for they all are in very poor shape. They notice they are being followed. After first being a bit frightened they confront the man and learn he wants to conduct business in the alley. It turns out he can sell and buy magic items for them. He has some stuff to offer, including a magical sling he bought recently.  However, the party does not have enough money yet. The Beard informs them he can get in contact with him if they go to the Massacrin and ask the bar man "Do you think Occams razor is real?".

Then the party continues towards Temple Island. There they quietly see how people there are praying for their knights who are raiding undead in the desert. Afterwards a man steps up he says they have to be strong and he ask the people there if he can preach it like he feels it? Then Zhetra (priestess they discussed with before, regarding when they should open Booles package) comes up to the stage and tells them everything will be all right. Afterwards the party asks Zhetra about the package but she says the party has not arrived yet. The party learns that this happens more often, but that this time there has been no word from the raiding party yet. The party also learns she thinks the party is definitely not up to the task of saving or going after the raiding party what so ever. She finally says the party should better go to the party of Pikur tomorrow, it is after all Krelka's (house elder at the time of the drought) birthday.

At night Sneak sneaks into their room and leaves the money for the sling in a small casket with a note:

> You were sleeping so nicely, I thought it best not to disturb you. Here is the money for the sling 
>
> Loves and kisses, Sneak. 

Djeke smells the papers and thinks he notices it smells slightly like Sneak and decides to keep it.

At the festival of Pikur Djeke is looking for bards and finds Ti-ak (the first bard from the Angry Troll).  They exchange niceties (How did my tip pan out? I heard you kick ass at the castle yesterday)  and then he says he has to offer them more information, but since information is the coin of power this time it will not be free. Djeke says they will play together for an hour and he will get the profit. They do so. Ti-ak sings of epic deeds of Krelka, and makes fun of his son Trakla in other songs. Afterwards he says a fellow named Penka is waiting outside the gate for them.

The party parties on. Listening to a speech of Smoke at the main square. And they notice some shroom users. The addicts gain in numbers as the day passes by. Finally they leave the centre. Outside the gate, in front of the Rakno & sons inn there is no one. Then they hear a womans scream. They run toward the sound and when they get there they see Penka, his dagger throwing buddy and 4 henchmen. Penka is punching the woman in the throat. Djeke, winning initiative, casts glitter dusts and blinds the WHOLE bunch.

Something what can best be described as a massacre follows. All of the thugs attempt to flee, blinded, while the party slaughters them one by one. Djeke hears someone screaming "fire, fire!" from the direction of the inn. A moment later a giant wolf jumps down the roof, on top of some poor thug, and jumps on the next roof. The party is too scared and believes too little in their own ability to chase the wolf. The wolf regards the battle in contempt and runs off as Arya casts expeditious retreat on herself and starts chasing the wolf. Tomas tries to keep up with the Arya.

As the chase ensues, with the wolf on the roof tops and Arya down on the streets. It turns out Arya is faster than the wolf. She tries to blind it with glitter dust, whelm and shoots arrow in the poor beasts back. Stein follows closely but eventually falls behind. Arya runs into an alley which has a dead end, but she jumps on the roof by using an opened window as stepping stone. There she manages to blind the wolf, but it is able to continue on its scent, albeit more slowly.

The chase moves forward to the more green area of Kak (poor part of Korokno).

Arya runs past the wolf and shoots at it with her bow and arrow, misses and is nearly killed as the wolf angrily bites her. The wolf disappears into a hole, which Tomas and Arya discover is hidden quite well, mundane and with some illusion (an illusory wall).

Halve of the chase involved a horse sized wolf, covered in golden glitters, running through the streets of Korokno. This did not go unnoticed. Neither was the little girl, who sped after this great wolf with incredible speed.

The four meet up at the place of the ambush/slaughtering. Two survived, the dagger throwing motherfucker (the worm) and some other guy. The other guy gains consciousness first. After he is charmed he changes his attitude to all of the partys member, offering him the opportunity explain a couple of things in a grand monologue. He explains the coins (they work in pairs, when one of them is flipped it appears at the other, but it only works one way), he says the Turaku does not pay much because The King only plays games (tournaments) therefor most of the soldiers have a second job as a thug in organizations such as The Band, and he explains Penka behaviour, that he was embarrassed by the party and that he changed for the worse because of it. He volunteered to behead the coward who did not fight against intruders at the Tan Tannery (where the party was ambushed and where they stole two masterwork leather). He then gathered some followers to try and ambush the party today. Capturing the woman and only beat her when a scout of his informed him that the party was at the inn.

Boole then attempts to convert the guy to Xatar, he explains that all followers of Xatar will find peace and safety. One has to use a hammer to hammer wrongs into rights, strengthening his argument by healing the guy magically a bit (lay on hands). The guy, called Kirby, believes this crap and says he needs money for food and to spread the word of Xatar (he believes the hammer should be used to build temples and stuff). So Boole gives him 12 gold. He says he will start building the temple for Xatar.

The party then helps put out the fire, which turned out to be another warehouse set on fire. The warehouse contained food and it is a lot harder to extinguish the flames without the clerics helping. Some buildings in the neighborhood are torn down to prevent the fire from spreading. Eventually they manage to extinguish the flames.

The next day they go down the druidic hole. It is very dark inside. They hear a faint guitar sound through the cavers with faint sound of many distant pickaxes smashing against stone (the guitar part was actually played). It is pitch dark inside. The cavern has rougher parts, which seem to be natural caverns. Other parts seem more human made.

At the first bifurcation they go left. At the dead end they hear someone cast summon monster behind them, and they fight and defeat a stone elemental. They back track and take the other turn. They again meet a dead end and fight a summoned brown bear (this included some grappling action of Boole). They backtrack, going back to the entrance but they discover there is an opening where there first was none.

They stumble upon a cross"cavern", left is a dead end which they can see nearly immediately. Tomas asks himself "Why would there be a dead end there?".

Then the session stops.
