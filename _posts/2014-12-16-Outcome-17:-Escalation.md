The situation is as followed: two squads of the Koroktal, reinforced with trainees, are camping in two houses at the edge of the square of SLMs house.  Serilious is in the larger, stone house, with squad A (Daddy Ray, good old Tor, Xoth and Rix). On the opposite side of the square is a smaller wooden house with squad BG (Versatalik (leader with a spear), Zint, Frox, Restek). Arya and Djeke are at "home" as sleep. Enkidu is at sleep in some house on temple island.


## Crazy Night
Daddy Ray and Serilious are just discussing some plans when when Xoth (a ranger/cleric type camping out on the roof) shouts down that he sees movement.  Serilious sees some guy on the roof. Then suddenly half of the house with squad B blows up. Serilious casts blindness on the person he sees walking on the roof before that persons fades away into the dark of the night.

Serilious takes squad A out to go and help. There they find that half of squad B has already perished to the fire and that the fire is spreading. They try to put it out but to no avail: the fire is spreading quickly and they have no choice but they wake up the city.

As the Koroktal and the peasants fight the fire Serilious casts a fireball on the SLMs house. A seeking ray is fired at him but misses, he spies upon the house and sees are a large warforged putting out the fire. When he leaves and later returns he learns from Xoth that he heard some people casting "create water" and that the fire on SLMs house is put out while the fire in the city is burning quite furiously.

Meanwhile, Arya and Djeke are having extreme nightmares. Djeke hears the commotion in the city and smells fire and goes out to explore. If only Arya had had spellcraft she might have known something about why her dreams were so nasty all of a sudden (friends and family burning, being torched, end of the world etc), it feels as if SLM is hunting her in her dreams.

Enkidu also awakens on temple island. He goes out to help fight the fire with water elementals. First the peasants are scared of the water elementals but they see that is quite effective. The peasants have created a barrier in order to stop the fire from spreading. Of course Enkidus tiger is instructed to haul water in some bucket, only scaring all the peasants. Two sulky Turaku guards press Enkidu to just keep the tiger with him in order to not scare the peasants, which finally Enkidu does. He sends the tiger out of the city.

Serilious in the meantime keeps watch of the house, and sitreps Daddy Ray every once in a while. Out of character the DM warned Stein that he was living very closely to the edge, in the sense of DYING again! (seriously, dude)

After a while the fire is stopped at the barriers.

Djeke arrives at the scene and meets up with Enkidu, together they meet up with Serilious and Daddy Ray. A plan is hatched to get more guys. Versatalik will go fetch the guys the Koroktal has been training. Daddy Ray will fetch guys from the Turaku. Djeke will fetch guys from the Turaku from Terpak city centre. His plan is to cash the favor of Mr. Pink (they won at the match at the castle a long time ago).

Serilious follows Daddy Ray and tells to put someone on watch and give him command of some soldiers. Then he goes to sit on the house some more.

Djeke finds Mr. Pink in the crowd and asks him to send some soldiers. Mr. Pink is glad to see Djeke again and says that he will gladly support their mission.  He asks Djeke to "take a walk with him". In private he tells Djeke that not everyone in the Turaku can be trusted. In his city centre he has some fellas who he knows he can trust. These men he sends out to eradicate the corruption within the city and the Turaku especially. He can spare 5 of those. Djeke says that he needs all his men and is a bit disappointed to learn that Mr. Pink wont oblige. Mr. Pink explains that he understands that this is a very important mission, but it also sound very dangerous. He needs his men to protect his part of the city if this thing goes south. Would Djeke not rather join him and his crew on the walls? Protect the people there? No, Djeke would not but he would take the 5 guys Mr. Pink offers. Mr. Pink says that his men will be here shortly, he will recognize them because they have beards. Bears and axes.

Whilst waiting Enkidu and Djeke think that it would be wise to evacuate this part of the city. So, when Versatalik arrives with 50 trained peasants all of which armed with spears and swords, Enkidu naturally engages in conversation and Versatalik is forced to halt the march of his soliders. Enkidu tries to explain that they should hide, Versatalik explains that he takes no orders from Enkidu and that he should talk to Daddy Ray.

Meanwhile, near Djeke, 5 bulky bearded dudes with axes appear. They follow Djeke at his command but are quite bored when Djeke spends the next hour instructing citizens to seek refuge in Pikur city centre. Djeke can talk very well and persuades most of the citizens who were planning on watching the battle. When Djeke notices there are too much peasants he instructs and motivates one group to take over the job of evacuating the citizens. Djeke is so inspiring, these peasants become almost competent.

Serilious meanwhile manages to persuade one ranger cleric to cast light on an arrow, and another to shoot it through the hole he blasted with his fire wall.  He first tries this himself but there is no way he can handle a composite longbow. He notices that there is some kind of fog in the house.

They wait until Daddy Ray arrives with 50 Turaku soldiers from the castle. After Enkidu has prayed they discuss the battle plan. Those in the meeting are: The King (commander of the Turaku and Trakla castle), Daddy Ray, Versatalik and the party. The plan is set up as followed: Arya will dispel the fog in the house, and haste squad A, squad B and the five bearded men of Djeke. They will charge the house and kill the vampire.

They walk in groups to the side of the square that faces the side of the house that  has the blasted hole in it. This means walking through the Turaku soldiers camp. Djeke hears some soldier whistling the melody of SLMs song and decides to investigate with his 5 bearded body guards.

The conversation starts out nice but quickly turns nasty as Djeke makes it known that he knows what song one of them was whistling. Two guys are still pretty okay and formally respond. One guy is a coward and sort of spills the beans: he does not want to be here anyway! Djeke tells one of the bearded men to stay here and watch these fellows.

Then, the assault, Arya successfully dispels the fog and the party charges in.  About 9 Koroktal knights and 4 bearded men with axes charge the house as Djeke plays encouraging music.

BWAAALM!!! A maximized fireball explodes among those charging, killing all but four: Daddy Ray, Frox, and 2 bearded men . They waver, but the party encourages them to move on. Two figures are seen in the hallway at the end of the house.  One of them is SPACE LORD MOTHERFUCKER! Enkidu rains down heavenly fire upon them (seriously, this stuff went literally through the roof).

Those charging are now inside the house: Daddy Ray charges the vampires at the end of the hall way but falls in a hidden pit, a bearded man barely manages to stop. BOOM!! Serilious casts a fireball on the two figures, the outer wall is blown away and SLM zips away the moment the sunrays hit his body (contingency: teleport), the other one jumps into the room next door.

The party now also advances, Enkidu is inside the house with 3 remaining soldiers when suddenly a large adamantine Warforged crashes through the doors and starts to calmly pound away at Enkidu. Behind the warforged is a vampire in polished leather armor who casts Bigbys striking fists, and the next bearded men dissapears into the pit.

Frox, the remaining cleric decides it is wise to heal his severely burned body and then casts searing light at the vampire. Enkidus tigers starts to grapple the warforged, the rest of the party (with the surviving ranger cleric Restek) move closer.

The house is severely on fire, a bed crashes through the upper floor. Arya communicates telepathically with Daddy Ray who had fallen down the pit. She receives the though "I am INSIDE something. Cutting my way out!"

The bearded axe man started to hack away at the warforged, but then becomes dominated by the vampires gaze and starts to hack away at Frox instead. Frox is okay with this for one round, but the next he strikes him and down goes the last bearded men.

The warforged is nearly down, in his last attempt he manages to win a grapple check and falls down the pit ... with Enkidus tiger. The already hurt tiger takes 5d6 falling damage.

Djeke casts grease, as the vampire tries to dominate Frox but fails and moves in gaseous form down the pit. The party follows descends down into the darkness using a staircase in one of the rooms. Enkidu casts light on his armor, Frox light on his shield.

Once down the have two options: straight ahead or to the right. Enkidu knows he should go right to find his tiger, but thinks he moved into the other hallway.  He moves back and tries the other hallway. Again he thinks he is moving down the wrong hallway. The party is confused and manage to split up/lose each other in the confusion: one part of the group is Djeke with Frox and Restek. The other part is Enkidu, Serilious and Arya.

Djeke with Frox and Restek come upon a room that has a platform. On the platform is a beautiful coffin. Some rocks stick out of the floor as stepping stones.  Djeke decides to grap a bottle of booze and torch and use the combination to burn down the coffin.

Meanwhile Enkidu, Serilious and Arya come upon a large room. The ceiling of the room has a hole through which they can see the remains of the house burning: every once in a while some burning timber falls down. On the ground lays the gear of the bearded man, the gear of Daddy Ray, and crashed warforged. On the opposite of the room is a hallway with Enkidus tiger. The tiger is hurt (nearly dead) and cowering. However, the most obvious about the room is the huge living plant (tendricilous or something). It is slimy, stinks and has tentacles and sharp wooden tooth for teeth.  It slams one tentacle in the hallway from where the group observes this. It is too large to leave this room.

The party takes it easy, Arya starts summoning a huge shadow fiendish centipede, Enkidu starts throwing some firey things at it. Then they notice a figure walking on one of the rooms, it is that same vampire!

Djeke is ready throw his bottle of booze. He rolls and ... rolls a natural 1. He splashes the bottle of good booze on the ground and the ground begins to shake (everywhere). He decides to run away and ignore his confusion.

The vampire, uses the distraction to try and drag the damaged warforged to the other hallway (where the tiger is). The huge plant fights and kills the huge shadow fiendish centipede and its attention focusses on the vampire. The vampire leaves behind the warforged and runs towards the hallway. The tiger, in a last ditch effort grapples the vampire, and the vampire downs it in one blow: the tiger is now bleeding to death. Arya casts haste.

The party can not quite see what is happening with the vampire afterwards, but they try and fight the plant as best as possible because the plant is now homing in on the unconscious tiger. Enkidu wildshapes into a raven in order to try and heal his tiger. Serilious fires a fireball to distract the plant: it works but now it is focussed on the small bird with an armor that has light. And so Enkidu is grabbed by the plant. Enkidu wildshapes in a large tiger before he is swallowed whole.

Serilious transforms into a polar bear, and shares his spell with his familiar.  Both charge the plant who they now has noted has regenerated most previous wounds. Arya moves around silently and can not heal the tiger because no UMD.  Enkidu claws his way outward.

Djeke, Frox and Restek arrive at the scene just intime to see a large tiger emerge from the side of a huge plant who is battling two large polar bears. He starts to play as the grounds begins shaking more extensively, a large crack appears on the wall and ceiling. Frox and restek begin firing at the plant.

Enkidu wildshapes into a bird once again and heals his tiger who had at this point -9 HP and was still bleeding! Save! The polar bears finishes the plant and they grab the adamantine warforged (so much money!!).

The party leaves: dodging falling boulders along the way. Enkidu airwalks with his tiger through the roof while the rest of the party walks up the stairway through the fire.

Outside, The King and two Turaku guards come to meet them. They step over the crisp burned bodies of 6 Koroktal knights.

"Did you get him?!?", he asks. "No", the party replies. The King roars a disappointing roar. Then the ground around them collapse into a pretty large crater. The centre is where once the house was.

"Well, some good: nomad caravan arrived". The King utters.

End of chapter 17.
