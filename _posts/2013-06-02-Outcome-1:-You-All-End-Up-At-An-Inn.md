Boole, Djeke and Arya walked to Korokno, walking the piece through the night. Killing a mud covered zombie near the city.

In the night they killed the zombie, a shop at the opposite side of Tomas house was ransacked. He was awoken by a scream and then spotted by thugs busting up the shop as he looked out the window.  Tomas ran outside, was attacked by one, charmed another one but finally ran. He was then "captured" by the corrupt Turaku guards.

The captain brought in the person (The Boss) who Tomas saw was in charge at the ransacking of the shop (he sees the symbol of The Band). The captain brought in the The Boss by flipping a coin up in the air, which then disappeared mid air. The Boss claims he saw Tomas busting up a shop. Tomas is put in a prison, which is an old pantry.

The other three entered the Massacrin, where they saw a pub brawl in progress.  Unknown to them, they saw Xatipatokt knocking out most of the guys there. Boole spotted a roguish character start the fight intentionally, slip away upstairs, and presumably murdering a person there. The person had black hair, blue eyes, leather clothing and a cap. The three found out the person was wealthy and associated with the house of Pikur.

They caught up with authorities, the captain of which tried to bribe them into pointing out Tomas as the murderer. None of them did, but Boole started screaming at the corrupt Turaku captain, at which point he was subdued and put in the prison next to Tomas.

Djeke and Arya negotiated that Boole would be released the next morning. Back at the Massacrin Djeke meets Ti-ak the bard.

Boole in the meanwhile busted out of prison in the middle of the night in the most obvious manner. Tomas had to charm one of the drunken guards in the process. Boole and Tomas go to the Raknos and sons inn and pay to get a message delivered to the Massacrin to warn Djeke and Arya. They meet up the next day at the Raknos and sons inn.

After a discussion Djeke and Arya go the keep and meet Keth the knight of the Koroktal and see how he reacts to the Captain of the corrupt Turaku guard. Keth made sure Djeke and Arya would bring Booles stuff back says he takes over the investigation of the murder in the Massacrin. He tells the two not to leave the city any time soon.

The party met Ti-ak the bard, who tells them he might know people who might know more about the shops being busted up.  He pointed them at Beet, whom they beet at Ter (a chess like game), who pointed them at Xatipatokt, whom they fail to beat at arm wrestling but do beat at LEG wrestling (a custom in Booles homeland), who pointed them at Tixly. They gathered information resulting in some minor facts that The Band a consist of thugs who now own territory more further up north. Also, they found out rumors that Xatipatokt once was with Tixly.

The next day they go to Tixly who said Penka was her son, that she had not spoken to him in quite a while. In exchange for the address they would kill the spider in the shit house, which they did. Boole promises to bring Penka to Tixly.

The party then proceeded to the house. Boole detected one evil person on the upper floor and 3 guard dogs at ground level. Boole finally knocked on the door while Arya climbed upstairs and finds Tomas gold in the short amount of time Boole buys by distracting the other guy and Penka. Boole finds out Penka is evil. Penka and the Worm tell Boole to piss of.

The party then hides, except for Boole which stands across the street, staring at the house. After SIX hours he knocks on the door and hell breaks loose.

The party hear the other guy scream FLIP THE COIN. A fight breaks loose, the guard dogs were splattered by Booles hammer. Penka was charmed by the part. The other guy (who threw dagger at Tomas), was knocked unconscious and was looted for his 2 daggers. Arya finds and steals 5 deter pieces from the house.

The party is chased away by dogs, they bring the charmed Penka to Tixly. They tried to question him but all they found out was that Penka did not know much either.
