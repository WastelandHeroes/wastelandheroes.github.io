During daytime Arya, Boole and Djeke scouted for Djeke's date with Sneak. Arya gathered information for the most romantic place in the city to "seal the deal" (get to first base), while Boole prayed to Xatar and Djeke gathered information for the places to take a girl out to eat.

Arya learned that the castle would be the best spot, and the temple afterwards. For there one could see the whole city and the river. So Arya went to the castle and got a soldier to show here around under the a sexual pretense. Arya even got the soldier as far as introducing her to her captain, Capta, a bold, bearded, fat man with crooked teeth. The captain however immediately dismissed the whole thing, leaving Arya with nothing but a slightly angry and extremely disappointed soldier.

Djeke learned that there are approximately 50 taverns/restaurants in the city. Anywhere in either of the two city centres would be okay, Kak is cheap, Boring town in boring but there is always the magical magician. Djeke even bought fancy clothes, but not the jewels that should go with it.

The date itself was okay, Sneak was dressed in a beautiful red dress. She was disappointed that Djeke wanted her to go out in Pikur centre, Terpak centre was okay but she would need to re-dress first, but she would not go there without here armor, not there. Finally Djeke proposed the magical magician to which she replied "Oh yeahh, that would be lovely!".

During their walk to the Magical Magician Sneak asked about where Djeke lived. She did thought living in inns was for the cheap kind of people.

In the magical magician Sneak had sweetened goat. Everyone was slightly annoyed at the bold, bearded, fat man with crooked teeth and his buddies who were being nothing but obnoxious. Sneak told Djeke that she knew the most nasty dude, his name was Capta and he was never to be trusted.

During the show the magician got fed up with the guys at the front row being annoying. So he brought in a guillotine and said that "he had enough of this!". His assistant tied him up, put his head to the guillotine and beheaded him! As the magicians head appeared to roll over the stage Capta and his buddies cheered! But, the magician said "Ha-ha but here I am", from within the crowd! The crowd applauded, but Capta and his buddies got angry. It was all an act? They started to mess things up. Sneak proposed to go, but Djeke took to the stage and played some music! The music was so played so well he was able to calm the bullies down.

The rest of the date they talked about their youth (Sneak had a way better backstory than Djeke by the way), and as they left Djeke got handed over some money and was told the dinner was on the house, "for your show and for calming those nasty people down").

Djeke proposed the temple for their next venture, unfortunately Sneak did not want to go there, she gave Djeke a friendly hug in front of the place where they always meet.

The next day the party discussed that they needed a house. Through a broker with a russian accent they learned a house with four rooms in the fancy part of town would cost about 7000 gold pieces. Paying with a down payment resulted in a higher price over all. In Kak, the broker said, some houses were actually free. "You only need to get rid of the vermin living inside first" he said. The rest of the day the party chilled around town. The next day they could go to the temple to open Boole's package, a gift from his homeland to the Koroktal.

The next day however an enormous dude with a torn leather jacket and nothing underneath stepped into the inn. The party recognized him, it was Xatipatokt! He said he wanted help with leg wrestling and in exchange he would introduce the party to his captain so they could fight for honor!

After a montage of Boole learning lieutanants Xatipatokt the art of leg wrestling they went to the castle. It turned out Capta was his captain and he would see if he could squeeze them in for a fight but they would have to wait outside.

Outside they were smack talked by some soldiers. They insulted everything, and they did that a whole lot better than the party tried to insult them. A crowd gathered and a guy in a fancy pink suit entered the castle. The party was challenged by these bullies and there was no chance to back out and keep their honor in tact, but ... they could only fight four versus four. Which they did not look forward to as they could only use "magic from the gods". Finally they accepted and Mr. Nas, a friend of Capta's would be the referee.

The rules: fair fighting, not to the death so at the end non lethal damage should be applied. No posion.  Only magic from the gods. If one says "mercy" one must leave the battle area and is out of the game.

The fight started and Tomas (sorcerer) quickly went down. Djeke had to pull back after some blows and Boole misses his smite attempt. Things did not look well for the party, but then Boole strikes one down, cleaves the other, scoring a critical hit. The guy flies away by the enormous hammer... there is no saving him! One guy was definitely not happy about this, "You bastard!!" he howled as he pulled out a dagger and rushed towards Boole. Halfway he fell, failed a fortitude safe and suddenly looked all green.  The fight was quickly over after this.

The guy in the pink suit approached the party, complements them on their awesome fight, introduces himself as Pink of the house of Terpak and says he put a Wager on them for his next business deal with the King, who is the commander in chief of the Turaku. This is not just a challenge, but an actual fair fight. The party accepts and is given a one time use healing check to get them patched up at a small temple in Terpak centre.

Right before the fight starts the party bets all their gold (1000 gold pieces), that they will win!

As the fight begins, Boole charges forward, holding his hammer with two hands and strikes at the enormous barbarian, giving the example for the rest of the party. At the flanks two guys with great swords attempt to disarm Boole but end up disarmed themselves. Arya and Tomas stay behind casting distance spells and summoning monsters (now they remembered they can bluff about arcane magic being divine magic) Djeke goes forward to help Boole but one of the disarmed guys steals his sword! He pulls back and starts with the whip again, tripping the guy who stole his sword.

Boole meanwhile has an enraged barbarian in front of him and two other guys. He equips his shield, but is nonetheless almost immediately down to his last hitpoints. He takes some steps back lays hands on himself, and is healed by Djeke.

The summoned monsters of Tomas seem unable to really do any damage in this battle. Arya's spell keep being negated by safes.

The fight continues when suddenly one of their foes charges past Boole and in one blow disables Tomas!  Afterwards he starts attacking Arya who stood beside him. Luckily for the party, the barbarian goes down.

The one whole stole Djeke's sword now also goes past Boole, and together with the one who was attacking Arya they surround Djeke. They gain flanking bonuses. Boole fights the one soldier who stayed behind, takes him out and turns around to save his buddy Djeke, but it was already to late. Djeke was down (with non lethal damage).

Angrily Boole attacks one of his foes and takes him out in one strike. The final dude put up quite a fight (he had improved feint, how awesome). But in the end it remained two versus one, leaving Arya with the most HP of the party for a change.

Pink congratulates the party when they come by. He says the house of Terpak owes them one, in case they ever need a favor.

The King looks pissed, but no one directly calls them on their use of profane magic... yet?
