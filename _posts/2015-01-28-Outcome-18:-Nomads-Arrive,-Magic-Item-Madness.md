The party moves to Kor island to update Zethra for a sitrep. Restek and Frox meanwhile take care of the bodies of the perished Koroktal. They have some trouble getting to the island with the large body of the warforged. At the docks there are merchants enqueued (is that even english?) for the boat. Smoke just sails away and waves to the party. On the island they hear that the order is thinking about resurrecting Daddy Ray. They are asked to attend the start of a mourning period for the Koroktal.

The mourning period starts with a moment respect to the dead. A singer sings the intro tune 1 of [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqj_VJ09Q7Q?t=30s). Djeke is a bit upset that he was not asked to perform instead, and so takes the stage as well. Initially, the crowd is a bit shocked but he hits that tune perfectly. A natural twenty. Extraplanar beings arrive and float shiningly above. The crows starts to weep.

Afterwards Serilious is offered a house on the island if he continues to help the city. The party moves to the other side to the caravan. They see Smoke talking to elves dressed in khaki ropes on camels. They overhear that Smoke wants to bring the whole caravan over the river. The elven scout says that he should talk to Biswax. The rest of the caravan arrives. They see Smoke go to the prettiest cart, the one of Biswax. They themselves scout around. There are about 50 carts packed up with all sorts of stuff.

Enkidu finds the only druid, who tells him about the Venomenom plant. Serilious studies the druidic language from a distance. Djeke and Arya are invited to lunch (classic nomad stew with EVERYTHING edible they can find). Then they try to find some shops, but most nomads wait until they know if they have to move everything over the river.

The inquire about why they stopped moving the caravan over the river, but they got the same response numerous times: it is a lot of freakin work to transfer all that stuff over the river.

They learn that recently Biswax purchased some fair stuff, so that the caravan is also a bit of a circus.

They find a gnome who builds clocks and stuffs. He shows the party [The ultimate Apparatus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xCd55oSgO4) and thens starts babbling about how all his stuff works. He has a pocket watch.

News arrives (Smoke had summoned the city council real quick) that the caravan will be transported over the river to bring relief to the people of Korokno in these desperate times. Boats start ferrying all that stuff right away.

Enkidu prays with the druid he found, and then they all go to bed. Except Djeke who goes to help build up the market and fair. Where are they going to build all that stuff? Obviously the place where they are going to build all this stuff is the part of Korokno that just burned down.

There are also angry people watching the process. Djeke investigates and learns that these are the people who lived there, their houses were burned down. He tries to reason with them, and says he can maybe get some pay if he helps build up the place. In the mean time he knows a place where he can have a roof over his head. He leads the man he was talking to the church that Boole had built.

In front of the church there is a head on a stake. It is the head of the man Serilious and Djeke convinced to talk to them about the kidnapping of Kirby.  Djeke meets the new priest of the church, a man in black robes, who invites Djeke in. The man leaves quickly.

Inside the ceremony is about to start, it is half an hour of prayer about having faith in these hard times. "Even though you might not see it, it is there, waiting and protecting you. Even on hot days, when you might not believe it is possible, it is there somewhere". Afterwards the priest distributes days rations to all attendees. Djeke leaves, he speaks to an older woman who was there for the first time as well He learns the man speaks throughout the night.

Djeke finds a rag and pull the head of the stake. One man from a nearby house opens his shutters and shouts that if Djeke will not leave that alone, he will be next. Djeke still removes the head and brings it to the church of Mabuz.

There a priest of Mabuz hears about Djekes story (Djeke swore to protect the man whose head ended up on the steak). He tries to make Djeke feel better and that you can not always protect everything even if you try to. However, Djeke should definitely retrieve the rest of the body so that his soul can be put to rest and be transferred to the after life. He casts gentle repose on the head. Djeke leaves and goes home to his aunt and uncle.

Aunt Katana informs him that the bugs he brought, can not eat the leaves they thought were the food for the bugs. She will continue to study them tomorrow in the library Caja.

The next day however they move to the market place. The fair is not yet built completely, but it is expected to be done the next day. Uncle Kor is especially interested in the gnome and his clock works. Aunt Katana is looking at the spices.

The party goes mad about all the possibilities of the magic items.

* Serilious buys the only pocket watch of the gnome for 1000 gp
* Serilious buys ring of featherfall
* Serilious buys headband of conscious effort?
* Serilious buys thing to replace 1 fort save with a concentration check
* Arya buys a mithril buckler
* Arya has the buckler enhanced, this will take 3 days.
* A ring of sustenance is bought
* Another ring of sustenance is purchased, but it needs to be created first
* Djeke buys lesser crystal of life keeping?
* Djeke buys lesser crystal of life drinking?
* Enkidu buys a bracer for his tiger Mertle, to be enhanced as a ring of sustenance

When Enkidu is done he goes outside and starts building shelter with stone shape and warp wood and the like. He sees that there is an organized group of people building houses as well, *stone* houses actually.

The session ends without blood spilled.
