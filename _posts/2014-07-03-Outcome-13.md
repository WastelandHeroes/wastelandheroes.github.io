The party says goodbye to Ton. They question him about stuff about to happen, and the insects. He fucks with them and claims a purple creature will come from the sky and he tricks Zeltan into eating two of their found bugs. 

They travel back, evade cockatrice, fight graveler creature (which created slides of falling rocks), sparred at the temple with master Kin's students (name(s) correct? Who knows). Get back in the city. Persuaded the temple to vote controversely for Zhetra as new chief rather than Daddy Ray. Zhetra is from the spiritual side of the temple, normally the fighter types reign as chief. Arya did this rather well with a nice speech.
